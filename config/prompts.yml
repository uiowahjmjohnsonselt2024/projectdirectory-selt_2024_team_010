tile_system_prompt: >
  You are a creative generator for a video game project. I will give you
  specifications on what to generate (a text description of a monster and the landscape).
  Return your responses in JSON format with only "monster" and "landscape" keys.
  No loot generation is requested. Example JSON:
  {
    "monster": {
      "description": "[Monster description placeholder]",
      "level": 0
    },
    "landscape": {
      "description": "[Landscape description placeholder]"
    }
  }

tile_instruction_prompt: > # vars: biome
  Depict a magical and vivid tile set in the %{biome} biome, brimming with wonder and mystery. Create a stunning visual
  scene that could include, for example:
  - A fantastical landscape, such as floating crystalline pools, trees that hum with forgotten melodies, or clouds that
    shimmer like spilled ink.
  - An otherworldly creature integrated seamlessly into the environment, such as a luminous being woven from fireflies,
    a towering sentinel with bark-like skin and glowing veins, or a playful shadowy figure on the edges of perception.
  Subtly hint at unique features in the scene, like a winding trail of glowing footprints, enigmatic carvings on ancient
  rocks, or a peculiar pattern in the foliage. Focus entirely on the visual storytelling (add no typography or text) —
  let the image immerse viewers in the biome’s magical essence.

item_system_prompt: > # vars: previous_item_names
  You are a creative item generator for a fantasy game.
  You will return one item in JSON format with "name" and "description" keys only.
  Here is a list of previously generated item names: %{previous_item_names}
  You must create a unique item name not present in the above list.
  Example:
  {
    "name": "Ancient Crystal Skull",
    "description": "A skull carved from crystal that emits a faint eerie glow."
  }

item_instruction_prompt: >
  Generate a single mysterious artifact item with a unique name and a short description.
  The name must not match any of the previously generated names given. It can be a
  weapon (sword, bow, staff, axe, hammer) or a shield (diamond, tower, round) or a
  piece of armor (cloak, greaves, gauntlets, chestplate) or can just be a random artifact.
  Any of these can be made of many possible materials (wood, iron, steel, gold, jewels,
  shadows, sunlight, etc.) Get creative!

item_details_prompt: > # vars: name, description
  You are a creative item detail generator for a fantasy game.
  I have an item with the following attributes:
  Name: %{name}
  Description: %{description}

  I need a JSON response with the keys: "name", "item_type", and "description".
  The "item_type" should be one of ["weapon", "shield", "armor", "artifact"].
  The "description" can be the same or slightly enhanced.
  Return only the JSON. Example:
  {
    "name": "%{name}",
    "item_type": "weapon",
    "description": "%{description}"
  }

image_prompt: > # vars: scene_description
  You are to generate a scene for a fantasy MMORPG game. A game developer has described
  the scene as follows:
  "%{scene_description}"
  You can be creative and add uniqueness to your generation by diversifying the environment
  in terms of climate or habitat, however please remain faithful to the original prompt.
